# Description App
ScannerApp is an institutional application developed for the Minuto de Dios University Corporation. Its main objective is to manage student access to specific spaces within the university campus, such as the Library and the Gym.

The system accurately records each entry made by students, allowing administrators to closely monitor the use of these facilities. This traceability facilitates the generation of reports, the analysis of attendance patterns, and the optimization of resources based on actual space usage.

Furthermore, ScannerApp has been designed with a modern, intuitive, and secure interface that adapts to institutional workflows and promotes efficient and automated access management. Its implementation strengthens internal organization, improves the student experience, and contributes to compliance with the control and security policies established by the university.
